\n is the newline character, while \r is the carriage return. They differ in what uses them. Windows uses \r\n to signify the enter key was pressed, 
while Linux and Unix use \n to signify that the enter key was pressed.
 In a standard ANSI keyboard, there's only Enter key, which is mapped to a carriage return charactor (13) in ASCII. 
 in Unix-like system, any carriage return is translated to a line feed charator (10 in ASCII) before handing to the program that receives the input.
